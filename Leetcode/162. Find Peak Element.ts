// 162. Find Peak Element - Medium 

// Description: 

// A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

// Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

// You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

// You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
// -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
// nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

// Solution:

function findPeakElement(nums: number[]): number {
    let left = 0
    let right = nums.length - 1
    while(left!=right){
        //console.log(left, right)
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right)/2)        
        if (nums[mid-1] > nums[mid]) right = mid
        else if (nums[mid+1] > nums[mid]) left = mid+1
        else return mid
    }
    // console.log(left, right)
    return right
};

//simple way o(n) is to check for nums[i-1] < nums[i] && nums[i+1] < nums[i]
//since the sides are -infinity there will always be a peak between a higher number and -infinity
//start in the middle. if left is higher this is the new right. if right is higher this is the new left. else this is the peak

//1 2 3 -> go to 2. left is 2, right is 3
