# codingChallenges
This repository is a collection of my JavaScript solutions for Codewars challenges, organized to showcase my problem-solving skills and commitment to coding excellence. Each solution demonstrates clean, efficient code, adhering to best practices for readability and performance. I aim to upload new solutions daily, covering a range of algorithmic challenges to strengthen my understanding and stay sharp in preparation for job opportunities. This repository reflects my dedication to continuous learning and improvement, with each solution representing thoughtful approaches to common coding problems, from data structures to logic puzzles. Feel free to explore and learn!

**Tech used:**  JavaScript

Primarily focused on Javascript to work on React and full stack web development. Will also be ocasionally working on python in the near future. 
Primarily focused on JavaScript for building dynamic, responsive web applications and interactive user interfaces, especially within the React ecosystem, as well as full-stack development, integrating front-end applications with back-end services and RESTful APIs, handling database interactions, and ensuring secure and optimized server-side processes.

Will be adding python soon too.
